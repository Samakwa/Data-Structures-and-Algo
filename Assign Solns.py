# Dr. Paul Tarauâ€™s Assignment
"""
Write a Python 3 program that:
- reads  a text document stored in a file
- counts how many times each token (word, punctuation or number) occurs in the file
- prints out the 5 most frequently occurring tokens, together with their occurrence count, one per line

Skills needed:

- reading a file into a string
- splitting a string into a list of tokens
- use of dictionaries
- iteration over lists and a dictionaries
- use of a sorting algorithm, built in the Python system

"us_constitution.txt" in this directory, for testing your code.
